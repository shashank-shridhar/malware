# malware
A small repository to store some malware that I write in my free time

//die.py : a small "ransomware", just bare bones atm, but it will essentially encrypt the contents of the root directory of the user. Just for practice. Will be adding a website to showcase the "ransom" of this app.

DISCLAIMER: No malicious intent with this, just for practice.

Will be fleshing it out and making it better, as I learn more about malware and computer vulnerabilities.
